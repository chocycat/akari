This directory contains the specification and documentation for Akari.

Akari is still in it's thinking stage. Most things will probably change.

The specification does not follow any solid formatting guide. It simply relays everything you need to know via simple, understandable text.

---

If it is your first time reading the specification, it is recommended to start in the following order:

1. [What is Akari?](./preliminary/intro.md)
2. [Akari's Goals](./preliminary/goals.md)
3. [Architecture]('./concepts/architecture.md')
