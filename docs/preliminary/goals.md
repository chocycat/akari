# Akari's Goals

**Standardize core features.** Common functionalities, such as input handling, are integrated into the core of Akari rather than left to individual implementations by managers or clients. Standardization ensures that all applications can rely on consistent behavior across different environments. This creates a more cohesive experience for both users and developers.

**Focus on modern hardware.** Akari is built specifically for modern hardware. Specific, niche and legacy hardware is completely out-of-scope; while it may work in some cases, it is not guaranteed. This focus ensures that Akari is future-proof and allows users to take full advantage of their hardware.

**Make security practical.** Akari will implement a user-centric permission model where users have explicit control over what applications can access. Permissions can be requested on an as-needed basis, ensuring that users are aware of what they are granting access to at any given time through commands, simple prompts or notifications.

**Prioritize minimalism.** The architecture of Akari is designed with minimalism. It avoids complexity and feature bloat that can often plague software. Each component of Akari serves a distinct purpose, ensuring that the system remains lightweight and efficient. If a feature doesn't serve a clear purpose, it doesn't deserve to be included.
